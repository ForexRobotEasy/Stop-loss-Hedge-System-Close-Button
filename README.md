## Overview

The Stop Loss Hedge System is an expert advisor that automates the process of minimizing trading risks through the use of a hedge trade. It monitors the profit/loss of the current position and triggers a hedge trade if the profit/loss falls below a certain threshold.

## How it Works

### Libraries and Functions

The necessary libraries and functions are included at the beginning of the code:

```c++
#include <Trade\Trade.mqh>
#include <Trade\PositionInfo.mqh>
```

### Constants

A constant `HEDGE_PIPS` is defined to specify the number of pips required to trigger a hedge trade:

```c++
const int HEDGE_PIPS = 20;
```

### Trade and Position Objects

The trade and position objects are initialized:

```c++
CTrade trade;
CPositionInfo position;
```

### Check Hedge Trade Function

The `CheckHedgeTrade()` function is responsible for checking if a hedge trade is needed. It refreshes the current position information using the `Refresh()` function and checks if the position is long and below the hedge pips threshold. If the conditions are met, it opens a sell trade of the same lot size:

```c++
void CheckHedgeTrade()
{
   if(!position.Refresh())
      return;

   if(position.PositionType() == POSITION_TYPE_BUY && position.Profit() < -HEDGE_PIPS)
   {
      trade.Sell(position.Volume());
   }
}
```

### Entry Point - OnInit()

The `OnInit()` function is the entry point of the expert advisor. It initializes the trade and position objects, sets the deviation in pips for trade execution, and selects the currency pair:

```c++
int OnInit()
{
   trade.SetDeviationInPips(5);
   position.Select('EURUSD');

   return(INIT_SUCCEEDED);
}
```

### Main Loop - OnTick()

The `OnTick()` function is the main loop of the expert advisor. It is executed on every tick. In this case, it checks if a hedge trade is needed by calling the `CheckHedgeTrade()` function:

```c++
void OnTick()
{
   CheckHedgeTrade();
}
```

### Error Handling - OnTradeError()

The `OnTradeError()` function is called when a trade error occurs. It simply prints the error code:

```c++
void OnTradeError(const int error)
{
   Print('Trade error occurred: ', error);
}
```

### Performance Optimization - OnTimer()

The `OnTimer()` function is called by the timer event and is used to optimize performance by limiting the execution frequency. In this case, it also checks if a hedge trade is needed by calling the `CheckHedgeTrade()` function:

```c++
void OnTimer()
{
   CheckHedgeTrade();
}
```

### Cleanup - OnDeinit()

The `OnDeinit()` function is called before the expert advisor is unloaded. It closes any open trades and prints a message indicating that the expert advisor has been unloaded:

```c++
void OnDeinit(const int reason)
{
   trade.CloseAll();
   Print('Expert advisor unloaded');
}
```
